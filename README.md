# Rock or Mine Classifier

This project aims to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines using logistic regression. The dataset used for training and testing contains sonar signals obtained from a sonar device. The signals bounce off different objects underwater, and by analyzing these signals, we can distinguish between rocks and mines.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Mines vs. Rocks dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 observations and 60 features, where each feature represents the strength of the sonar signal at a particular angle.

## Approach

Logistic regression is used as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification tasks. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and scaled to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify rocks and mines based on sonar signals.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and run the `main.py` script. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, which can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
